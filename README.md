🧠 Breast Cancer Prediction
Machine Learning & Deep Learning for Medical Diagnosis

















📖 Overview
This project develops an intelligent classification system to predict whether a breast tumor is Benign (B) or Malignant (M) using Machine Learning and Deep Learning models.
The main objective is to compare classical ML approaches with Artificial Neural Networks to determine performance differences on structured medical data.

🏥 Medical Context



Breast cancer remains one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide.
Early detection significantly improves survival rates.
Artificial Intelligence can assist medical professionals in decision-making processes.

📊 Dataset Description
The dataset includes numerical features computed from digitized images of breast mass cell nuclei.
Feature Categories:
